# My personal setup script for Windows

This is a script that I use to install all the programs I need to work on my Windows machine.


### Quick start
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; Invoke-Expression ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaahila/setup/refs/heads/master/setup.ps1'))
```
